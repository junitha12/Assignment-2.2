Read multiple JSON files into a directory to convert into a dataset.
I have files text1, text2, text3 in the directory JSON.
Answer:setwd(path of the directory pointing to JSON)
myfile <- list.files(path, pattern = "*.json", full.names = TRUE)
myJSON <- lapply(myfile, function(x) fromJSON(file=x))

2. Parse the following JSON into a data frame.
js<-'{
"name": null, "release_date_local": null, "title": "3 (2011)",
"opening_weekend_take": 1234, "year": 2011,
"release_date_wide": "2011-09-16", "gross": 59954
}'

Answer:library(rjson)
data.frame(t(unlist(fromJSON(js))))
Output:     title opening_weekend_take year release_date_wide gross
1 3 (2011)                 1234 2011        2011-09-16 59954
3. Write a script for Variable Binning using R.
Answer:
binning(x, y, breaks, nbins)
where x and y are vector or a matrix with either one or two columns.
breaks: either a vector or a matrix with two columns (depending on the dimension of x), assigning the division points of the axis, or the axes in the matrix case. It must not include Inf,-Inf or NAs, and it must span the whole range of the x points. If breaks is not given, it is computed by dividing the range of x into nbins intervals for each of the axes. 
nbins:the number of intervals on the x axis (in the vector case), or a vector of two elements with the number of intervals on each axes of x (in the matrix case). If nbins is not given, a value is computed as round(log(length(x))/log(2)+1) or using a similar expression in the matrix case.
